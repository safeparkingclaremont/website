title: Safe Parking Claremont
---

> Claremont United Church of Christ will not be moving forward with the Safe Parking program
> at this time due to the severe reduction in homelessness funding at the federal, state,
> and county levels. The church and community is committed to using our resources to serve
> Claremont and address the challenges of homelessness and affordable housing.
