Claremont United Church of Christ proposes in 2026 to host [SafeParkingLA](https://safeparkingla.org/),
a non-profit organization providing safe overnight parking and extensive supportive services or individuals 
living in their vehicles. The goal is to provide participants with an expedited transitional pathway to stable housing.

- Participants would be local and carefully vetted
- Participants must own or have proven permission to use their vehicles, which must be operating
- Participants must have a valid driver's license
- SafeParkingLA provides constant overnight bonded licensed security, as well as caseworkers to help participants access other needed resources and services.
- Site would remain available for regular parking every day.
